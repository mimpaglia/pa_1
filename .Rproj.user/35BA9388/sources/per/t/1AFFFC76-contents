The duration of habló is `r dif_hablo` ms longer than hablo.  
The duration of the unstressed /o/ is `r dif_o` ms longer than the stressed /o/.  
The intensity of the midpoint of the stressed /o/ is `r dif_int` db greater than the intensity of the midpoint of the unstressed /o/.  
The pitch of the midpoint of the unstressed /o/ is `r dif_f0` Hz greater than the pitch of the midpoint of the stressed /o/.  

## Conclusion  

From listening to the two words hablo and habló, it sounded to me that the duration of hablo is longer but this assumption was incorrect.  As expected, the duration of the unstressed /o/ is slightly longer than the stressed /o/.  It is also shown that while the intensity of the of the unstressed /o/ is greater than the stressed /o/, the pitch of the stressed /o/ is greater than the unstressed.  Further investigation needed to see if pitch and intensity are related to stress put on a specific vowel.
